# micro:Pi

The micro:Pi is the ultimate device for developing skills and knowledge about the 'Internet of Things'. It avoids any need for messy wires and instead provides onboard functionality and expansion sockets. These feature an 0.96" OLED display, sockets for DC Motors and I2C Grove compatible interfaces (up to an addition 127 sensors). The operating system is pre-installed so you can start developing right away. There are FREE online tutorials for building robots, home automation, computer programming and an entire remote learning eco-system is being developed at topAcademy.com.
